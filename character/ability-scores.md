> You generate your character's six ability scores
randomly. Roll four 6-sided dice and record the total of
the highest three dice on a piece of scratch paper. Do
this five more times, so that you have six numbers. If
you want to save time or donâ€™t like the idea of randomly
determining ability scores, you can use the following
scores instead: 15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8.

4d6 keep 3, 5 times

14, 16, 12, 17, 7, 15
